<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Thanks for coming here. 
I recently completed my M.S. degree in Data Science, and I am passionate about applying artificial intelligence algorithms to solve business problems and create value. My research interests focus on language models, generative algorithms in Natural Language Processing, and multimodal learning. Iâ€™m eager to continue exploring and contributing to the ML/AI industry. 
Feel free to browse this site to explore my projects or check out my resume.
